This to change.

Add locking, so only one instance can work at a time/access JTAG

Locking will wait for a timeout, then exit if it does not get exculusive
access.

Add a config method so we can run 4-5 versions, each one with a
different destination. One with All destinations.

It will configure the MUX upon connection from ethernet, and succesfully
getting access to the JTAG via the lock file.

When exiting, it will tristate the jtag port.
